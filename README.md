# fem2d

Basic finite element code developed during my PhD. The focuses was on finding shape sensitivities w.r.t load displacement paths for non-linear sturctual problems. Therefore, the code is written for small mesh FEM problems with the focus being developping an understanding of FEM and the implementation of design sensitivities.

The code includes, three basic element types, three solvers, and three meshers for simple structual problems.

## Solvers:

1. Linear
2. Non-Linear
3. Arc Length

## Element types

1. Q4
2. 5 $\beta$
3. Q8

## Basic Meshers

1. Cantilever
2. Deep SemiCircular Arch
3. Curved Beam

## Example Usage
